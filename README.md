# MLB Scores Website

[This website](https://ajaypatel-8.github.io/mlb-games/) was created using React through Javascript as a way for me to improve my understanding of the framework and language. It serves as a simple view of MLB games on any given date.

Some relevant features it supports:

- DatePicker: view any date and any games that occurred/will occur
- Box scores: displays inning by inning runs, final runs/hits/errors along with a toggle to show more stats including LOB/K/BB and more
- Player links: by clicking on a shown player, the site will redirect you to their Baseball Savant page
- Game recaps: links to MLB's game recap articles are provided for each completed game
- Savant game feeds: links to Baseball Savant's in-depth game feeds are provided for each completed game
- Lineup modals: pop up modals containing summaries of a team's lineup and pitchers from each completed

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Thank you for visiting!
